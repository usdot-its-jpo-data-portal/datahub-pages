### Issue trackers
Contributors will utilize Github's issue tracking system to record and manage issues that are reported by users.
These may include performance requests, found bugs, and new requests. The follow operating procedure highlights 
how the DataHub development team will address and respond to reported issues.

### Pull requests

All software development teams, regardless of being a member of the repository or external contributor, 
are required to submit their changes in a Pull Request (PR). The `master` branch is protected against direct commits. 
All commits to `master` branch would have to be processed through a PR. Changes must be committed to a separate branch, 
pushed to GitHub and PR created to merge the branch to `master`. The `dev` branch has been set aside for daily updates 
and will contain the latest commits but does not necessarily contain a `stable` build. The `dev` branch is work in 
progress until the changes have been reviewed in a PR and approve, at which point, the branch can be merged to `master`.

All pull requests will be reviewed by the DataHub team. The team member will either request for additional details, 
merge it to the baseline, request changes to it, or close it with an explanation. For major changes, the reviewer 
may require additional support from the team, which could cause some delay. We'll do our best to provide updates and 
feedback throughout the process. Feel free to open pull requests, and the DataHub team will provide feedback.

**Before submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:
	
	1.	External contributors must first fork the repository in their own personal or organization.
	2.	All contributors must create a branch from `master`, `dev` or any other branch desired.
	3.	If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
	4.	Ensure the tests pass. Our target is 90% coverage
	5.	Update the documentation.
		- User QA procedures are documented within the Github Wiki
		- Architecture and user guide documentation should be included in the word document under the `docs/` folder
		- Please contact the DataHub with qny questions
	6.	Format your code as outlined in the style guide

### Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at Ariel.Gold@dot.gov. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
